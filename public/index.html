							value: "About Us",
							label: "<p>SportRχiv is the first community-led and open access subject repository dedicated to sport, exercise, performance, and health research. As a repository, we appreciate the interdisciplinary nature of our respective fields and accept submissions from those working in all aspects of sport and exercise science (also known as kinesiology and movement science), sport and exercise studies, rehabilitation and therapy, through to theatre, dance, and performance studies. We believe our service has a range of benefits, but here is a list of our six key features:\n  Speedy dissemination. Research submitted to the archive is usually approved within 3-5 working days. That means your work can be read, cited, and built upon up-to two-years earlier than your colleagues who solely progress through the standard peer-review process. Plus, submitting your work to us takes two minutes. Less if you already use the Open Science Framework (OSF) to manage your project.    Generate feedback. By sharing your research on SportRχiv, you can gain immediate feedback on your submission, which we hope will improve the overall standard of your work. Better to catch an error before publication than being forced to make a post-hoc correction.    Support your community. Like it or not, we’re all in this together. By sharing with SportRχiv, you support a non-profit enterprise whose primary aims are to make research openly available to all and protect said research for future generations. If these issues are not important to you, how about the fact that as a non-profit, we are often not subject to the same embargo periods other repositories are forced to adhere to?    Get instant credit. If you’re a young scholar, demonstrating your work as a preprint looks considerably better on your CV than merely listing a paper as in preparation. Plus, submissions are listed on Google Scholar, which increases your visibility and may help potential collaborators find you. In the internet age, it makes no sense to wait up to two years to get credit for your work!    Protect your intellectual property. We issue a digital object identifier to manuscripts submitted to SportRχiv, which protects you from scooping and plagiarism. Of equal importance, by licensing your work through us, you retain ownership of a version of your work. This means that you’ll never have to request permission from major publishers to use figures or materials that you created, which is nice.    Link your data and material. We are based on the OSF, which means that you can link directly to your data and materials — increasing transparency and openness.   Since its inception in early 2017 and launch in August, SportRχiv has amassed a strong multi-national steering board with representatives for each discipline. By using this service, researchers are guaranteeing a version of their work remains freely and legally available to all. Further, as SportRχiv is a non-profit, many publishers permit the immediate sharing of post-prints without the embargoes associated with for-profit organisations. Lastly, as a community run initiative, we welcome your input and aim to create a service that meets your needs.\nWe hope you find the service of use and welcome any feedback.\nProudly supported by the Society for Transparency, Openness, and Replication in Kinesiology (STORK).\n</p>",

							label: "<p> Do we run into any challenges with publishers if SportRχiv assigns a DOI before a publisher that accepts a paper?\n  In terms of creating two DOIs, publishers have no issue with this and there is no legal issue. A preprint is an ‘author version’ of the document and you almost always retain the rights to pre- and post print versions when publishing research. It is this author version that is assigned a DOI and then the published version is then assigned another. Cleverly, the major search engines have now written an algorithm to avoid any confusion by pairing the versions, which means that shared pre-\/post prints link to the typeset publisher version and both versions count towards your h-index   Do I lose copyright privileges when I submit a document to the archive?\n   No. Upon submission to SportRχiv you are required to state how you wish to license the work. This allows you to retain copyright and state how others may copy, distribute, and make use of your data. If you do not see the license you want to use, you can upload your own license.\n  If you are unsure what license to apply to your work, there is lots of good information online. For example, the website http:\/\/choosealicense.com\/ provides an interactive license picker.\n   If I post a preprint on the archive and then publish it in a journal or volume, can I leave the preprint on the archive?\n  In the vast majority of cases the answer is yes. We would recommend that you check the journal’s policy on preprinting before submission though. If you can’t find the policy details, check our interactive journal policy list or get in touch.   Won’t submitting a preprint be perceived by others in the scientific community as an attempt to bypass blind review and\/or disseminate work before it has been vetted by the scientific community?\n  Submitting a preprint is most definitely not an attempt to bypass the peer review system. By definition it is a ‘pre’ publication print and it is a requirement on SportRχiv that this be stated on the opening page. In terms of disseminating research before it has been through peer review, there are two sides to this argument. Some would argue that the speedy dissemination of research to thousands of potential reviewers is a good thing. Others think that waiting often upwards of six months for two people to read and comment on a manuscript is fine. Ultimately, if you believe in the value of peer review, you should not present a preprint as having gone through the process. However, these concerns are not limited to preprinting. Individuals have been sharing unpublished work or conference presentations with the media for as long as there has been media interest. It is not the medium by which work is communicated that is the problem here.   Won’t it look bad if I have to change a manuscript substantially after peer review?\n  No. It’s very common to have to make substantial changes to a manuscript based on the feedback provided in peer review. Part of the preprint process is about receiving feedback to improve the quality of the work and a change in direction would be perfectly normal. Of the 2 million preprints already submitted to BioRxiv and the like, we suspect (and hope!) that a large portion of those will have changed substantially as a result of making the work freely available for comment. It is far better to catch an error in a working document than once it is published.   By sharing work before it is peer reviewed, we run the risk of distributing work before it is vetted and errors are corrected, don’t we?\n  We appreciate that peer review has historically been viewed as proof of scientific vetting, but with redactions on the rise, we have seen first hand that peer review is not a very good approach to vetting work for errors. Also, if the goal is error detection, having many pairs of eyes examine a working version of the document is far more likely to catch a mistake than two peer reviewers. Plus, finding an error in a working document is much easier to correct.   Science should be accessible only after it has been peer reviewed, shouldn’t it? Peer reviewers, as gatekeepers of science, limit the thicket of information\/documents scientists produce. Without them, won’t we become over run with bad science?\n  It arguably could, but the evidence suggests that it doesn’t. As previously mentioned, the likes of ArXiv have been sharing preprints for decades and by and large, the work shared is simply an open access version of an prepublication draft. We use a pre-publication moderation system to check that manuscripts accepted in the SportRχiv meet basic scientific standards. From there, the scientific community can review and comment on the work in an open and transparent manner. Publishing low quality work in any form and in any outlet may have a detrimental impact on an author’s reputation. As such, it is unlikely that the quality of work shared within SportRχiv will be any lower than that published in the literature.   Despite the very good intentions of the SportRχiv initiative, there will be researchers that view it skeptically and as a mechanism to “publish” half-baked work or corrupt the traditional review process.\n  Preprints are not published and won’t count towards any institutional targets. They will, however, demonstrate effort, which I think should be valued. Preprints are not designed to circumvent peer review, but rather get feedback earlier on in the process and make the work publicly available. Having many eyes on a working document is more likely to catch an error than limiting it to one or two reviewers. Scholars would undoubtedly prefer to openly share the published version of their work, but publishers are not going to allow this. It is crazy that we give our work away to for-profit publishing houses, organise and review the work for them for free too, and then pay to buy it back back. If the general public knew about this, they’d seriously start questioning whether we are as intelligent as we claim! Schools\/funders shouldn’t have to pay thousands of pounds\/dollars to license work they have previously funded and given away. The system is daft and SportRχiv simply provides part of a solution to a ridiculous problem. That said, it is the best option we have at present and will be around until institutions take back control of the publishing industry.   Will posting on the archive affect subsequent attempts to publish in a journal?\n  It shouldn’t, however, as a relatively new service it is hard to say conclusively. All of the major publishers permit the sharing of preprints to services such as ours. Although new to sport and exercise, preprints have been routinely shared for decades in other fields. As such, we would expect sport and exercise journal editors to be supportive of submissions that have been shared on SportRχiv. Some researchers are even going as far as to mention their preprints within covering letters to editors.   Is this service a replacement for journals?\n  No. SportRχiv is not intended to replace journals. A preprint service is primarily intended to offer access to manuscripts before publication, solicit feedback, and ensure the research remains Open Access. Formal peer review remains an integral part of science, and all submissions submitted to SportRχiv should undertake this process.   How should I cite articles on the archive?\n  To cite a preprint uploaded to SportRχiv or OSF in general, you should provide the author’s full name and year, followed by the preprint’s title, the preprint server name, and the persistent URL.   Won’t someone steal my work if I share a preprint before it’s accepted for publication?\n  Posting a preprint can actually prevent scooping. Because preprints are time-stamped upon creation, you’ve established the precedence of your work by posting one. If someone is prepared to steal from a time-stamped\/DOI’d preprint, they would likely do the same from any form of published or unpublished work. As plagerising any content results in serious reputational harm, it very rarely happens.   May I remove a preprint once it is posted?\n  The preprint file cannot be deleted, but it can be updated or modified. See the OSF for more advice here.   Am I ok to share my preprint on social media?\n  Of course! Just be clear that the manuscript is a working document that is yet to undertake peer review.   Can I share post-prints on SportRχiv?\n  If the journal policy permits, we are happy to accept accepted manuscripts. Author accepted versions are often permitted, but ‘final’ typeset versions rarely are. If you’re in any doubt, get in touch.   Can I link data to my preprint?\n  Yes. We are based on the Open Science Framework and they allow the integration of a range of services that facilitate data linkage (see here).  </p>",

We do, however, examine the work to identify whether basic standards, detailed herein, of reporting have been met.\nThe appearance of work is an invitation to the public and scholarly community to share, review, discuss, and evaluate it (and its linked or associated research materials). Acceptance is not a statement of research quality, but rather that basic standards of reporting and topic relevance have been met.\nSportRχiv accepts papers at any stage of the publication process. We moderate papers before they appear publicly, which is called “pre-moderation” on the Open Science Framework platform. To learn more about how this moderation works on our system, visit this page from our hosts. Subject to volume demands, we expect to post papers submitted for moderation within 3-5 business days (although we aim to turn this around as quickly as possible).\nThe SportRχiv moderation process ensures submissions:\n Qualify as scholarly content. This includes original research, current opinions, commentaries, review articles, case studies, short communications, hypotheses, ‘negative’ results, technical reports, and data and methods papers. Work on SportRχiv is either research or engages with research. As such, we do not accept blog posts, dissertations (submit such documents to thesiscommons.org), or other communications that do not adhere to academic publishing standards.\n  Fit our scope of research. We accept work from across all domains of Sport, Exercise, and Physical Activity. This includes, but is not limited to, Rehabilitation Sciences; Sport and Exercise Sciences; Sport and Exercise Studies; and Theatre, Dance and Performance Studies.\n  Are approriately categorized. We allow authors to select their own categories from our subject taxonomy, but check whether there are obvious errors or categorizations that lack plausibility.\n  Are correctly attributed. We do a simple Internet search to see if someone else has publicly claimed authorship of the work.\n  Are in languages that we can moderate. At this time we are only accepting English langauge submissions.\n Please see review our Submission Guidelines, and check for compliance with our database of Journal Policies before submitting.\nCopyright compliance Moderation does not include verification of copyright status—This responsibility lies with submitting authors. We ask that authors share only that work they have the right to share. When work is in review or about to go into review, authors may wish to check the SHERPA\/RoMEO website or individual journal policies for peace of mind. Please note, however, that the vast majority of publishers permit the sharing of preprints. If you are uncertain about this part of the procedure, please contact us.\nClaims of copyright infringement should be sent to the Center for Open Science in accordance with their policy, which is here. Procedure\nWork will be reviewed by a moderator before appearing publicly within the SportRχiv repository. If a submission is not accepted, the moderator will include a description of the reason. Work that does not pass moderation will remain on the OSF platform, but will not be identified as part of SportRχiv. Authors are free to re-submit work after addressing the issues raised by the moderator. Authors may also contact us at andy@sportrxiv.org.\nPlease note: At present we do not have the capacity to query authors during the moderation process. If a paper does not pass moderation we will specify reasons, but we cannot discuss the reasons with the author prior to making a decision. Please do not be discouraged by negative moderation decisions and feel free to contact us with any questions!\n</p>",

Before getting to this stage, please ensure your potential submission meets our submission guidelines. If your article does not conform to these basic guidelines then your submission may be rejected. Next, you will first need to create an OSF account in order to upload preprints to the repository. You can do this by clicking the here.\nUsing one of our submission templates will likely ensure compliance with this checklist\nPre-Submission Checklist  A co-author agreement statement must be included  A declaration stating that all co-authors approve the manuscript and its submission to SportRχiv must be included in the article (preferably on the cover page). For example:\n Co-Author Agreement: We the authors agree to the sharing of this preprint on SporRχiv\n There must be a statement on the cover page that the work is pre or post- print  Our readers need to know whether or not the submission is pre-peer review (preprint) or has been accepted for publication at a peer-reviewed journal elsewhere (postprint). This statement can be put in the header or footer of the article. If the article is a postprint please consider adding a link to the accepted journal article once it is available.\nThe article DOI must be reported in the article  The document object identifier (DOI) for each submission is minted once the article has been accepted by our moderators. However, we encourage authors to include a space for this to added on the cover page of the article (see example below). Once the DOI is minted, it is expected that authors add the DOI to the cover page within 7 days.\nThe manuscript’s citation must be included on the cover page  An example of a citation for the article must be included on the front cover. An exact citation style (e.g., APA) is not required.\nWhen ready, the final submission’s cover page should look similar to the image below.\nEnsure that the manuscript meets basic scientific reporting standards  Reporting standards vary from article type and field.

Sub-disciplines include biomechanics, development and management, history, philosophy, physiology, physiotherapy, psychology, and sociology — to name a few.\nSubmissions fall under two major types of article: (1) Prepublication versions of manuscripts (i.e., preprints) that have been submitted or are in the final stages of submission to a peer reviewed academic journal, and (2) Previously published research that you wish to make Open Access. Please note that we do not accept the publishers typeset Version of Record, but rather the the pre- (Author’s Original Version) and post-(Accepted Manuscript) print versions. If you are unsure, please email us and we will be happy to help.\nWe accept the following article types: original research, current opinions, commentaries, review articles, case studies, technical reports, and short communications. However, we do not accept blog posts, dissertations (submit such documents to thesiscommons.org), or other communications that do not adhere to academic publishing standards. Before sharing your work, we suggest you check your target journal’s policy on the posting of preprints and\/or the SHERPA\/RoMEO service for details of permitted use. General Submission Guidelines\n  At this time we kindly request that all manuscripts be submitted as PDF. Under the current submission system the file type cannot be changed once submitted.\n  As with traditional publishing models, it is a requirement that all co-authors are aware of, and have agreed to, submission and all named authors will be notified upon upload. A co-author agreement statement is required before the work will be accepted.\n  Before submission, we advise that manuscripts are carefully checked. Unlike traditional journal submissions, the burden of quality control lies with the author. A thoroughly prepared preprint will help to build your scientific reputation. However, a poorly prepared preprint with scientific errors and\/or even grammatical mistakes have the opposite effect. Although not a requirement, we suggest all submissions undertake some form of typesetting to aid legibility. Free software such as LaTeX is available to help with this process.\n  Before acceptance, a note on the front page stating whether the manuscript is a pre- or post-print is required. If the article is a postprint feel free to include a link to the journal article.\n  A note on how to cite the work, and the DOI, must be included on the cover page. We encourage the use of the automatically generated citation produced by the OSF when submitting the work. Once a DOI number has been issued, it is also worth updating the manuscript using the inbuilt version control system to include instructions on how to cite the work.\n  Many publishers will allow for preprints to be updated post peer review. However, it is important to note that options for the submission of post-prints can be more limited. In general, it is advised that you utilise our version control software to keep track of revisions and to make sure your work can stay in the public domain.\n  One of the key features of submitting a preprint is accessing constructive feedback. As such, we require authors to state the corresponding author’s email address on the title page. We also encourage authors to list their Twitter handle as this aids community interaction with the research.\n  All submissions will go through a basic screening process to check for conformation with these guidelines. Submissions that do not meet these guidelines will be removed, and the authors notified.\n  All submitted work must be related to sport, exercise, health or physical activity research. Furthermore, all research must be correctly classified and\n  Please note that these guidelines are subject to change and view our FAQ page for a broader explanation of what can be submitted.\nAlso, we understand that conforming to guidelines can be difficult. Therefore, we have created template documents that authors can use for their own submissions. Click this link to see the templates.\n</p>",
