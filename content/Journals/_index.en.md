description: Our database of journal policies on preprinting
title: Journal Policy List
type: docs

We have created a list of pre-print, post-print self-archiving policies for journals that publish peer reviewed sport and exercise research. A full version of the database is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X9sBKi6yN2a8au1O2YMEzWhN-UuIhShULxwDvJpwUrU/edit#gid=0). The database is open and free for anyone to edit, and will automatically update the table below with changes. The list is by no means exhaustive and the community is encouraged to update accordingly. Please note that many journals do not have explicit self-archiving policies. Where this is the case, we are currently seeking confirmation as to what is permitted and what is not.

| RoMEO Colour  | Archiving Policy  |

| Blue  |  Can archive post-print (ie final draft post-refereeing) or publisher's version/PDF |

| White  | Unknown |
