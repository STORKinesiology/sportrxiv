At SportRχiv we accept submissions from those working in all aspects of the disciplines of sport and exercise science (also known as kinesiology and movement science), sport and exercise studies, rehabilitation and therapy, through to theatre, dance, and performance studies. Sub-disciplines include biomechanics, development and management, history, philosophy, physiology, physiotherapy, psychology, and sociology — to name a few.

Submissions fall under two major types of article: (1) Prepublication versions of manuscripts (i.e., preprints) that have been submitted or are in the final stages of submission to a peer reviewed academic journal, and (2) Previously published research that you wish to make Open Access. Please note that we do not accept the publishers typeset Version of Record, but rather the the pre- (Author’s Original Version) and post-(Accepted Manuscript) print versions. If you are unsure, please email us and we will be happy to help.

We accept the following article types: original research, current opinions, commentaries, review articles, case studies, technical reports, and short communications. However, we do not accept blog posts, dissertations (submit such documents to thesiscommons.org), or other communications that do not adhere to academic publishing standards. Before sharing your work, we suggest you check your target journal’s policy on the posting of preprints and/or the SHERPA/RoMEO service for details of permitted use.
General Submission Guidelines

1. At this time we kindly request that all manuscripts be submitted as PDF. Under the current submission system the file type cannot be changed once submitted.

2. As with traditional publishing models, it is a requirement that all co-authors are aware of, and have agreed to, submission and all named authors will be notified upon upload. A co-author agreement statement is required before the work will be accepted.

3. Before submission, we advise that manuscripts are carefully checked. Unlike traditional journal submissions, the burden of quality control lies with the author. A thoroughly prepared preprint will help to build your scientific reputation. However, a poorly prepared preprint with scientific errors and/or even grammatical mistakes have the opposite effect. Although not a requirement, we suggest all submissions undertake some form of typesetting to aid legibility. Free software such as LaTeX is available to help with this process.

4. Before acceptance,  a note on the front page stating whether the manuscript is a pre- or post-print is required. If the article is a postprint feel free to include a link to the journal article.

5. A note on how to cite the work, and the DOI, must be included on the cover page. We encourage the use of the automatically generated citation produced by the OSF when submitting the work. Once a DOI number has been issued, it is also worth updating the manuscript using the inbuilt version control system to include instructions on how to cite the work.
  
6. Many publishers will allow for preprints to be updated post peer review. However, it is important to note that options for the submission of post-prints can be more limited. In general, it is advised that you utilise our version control software to keep track of revisions and to make sure your work can stay in the public domain.

7. One of the key features of submitting a preprint is accessing constructive feedback. As such, we require authors to state the corresponding author’s email address on the title page. We also encourage authors to list their Twitter handle as  this aids community interaction with the research.

8. All submissions will go through a basic screening process to check for conformation with these guidelines. Submissions that do not meet these guidelines will be removed, and the authors notified.

9. All submitted work must be related to sport, exercise, health or physical activity research. Furthermore, all research must be correctly classified and

Please note that these guidelines are subject to change and view our FAQ page for a broader explanation of what can be submitted.

Also, we understand that conforming to guidelines can be difficult. Therefore, we have created template documents that authors can use for their own submissions. Click this link to see the templates.
