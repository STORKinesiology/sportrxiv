SportRχiv accepts scholarly work from across fields related to sport, exercise, and physical activity. We do not assess the quality or perceived merit of the work. We do, however, examine the work to identify whether basic standards, detailed herein, of reporting have been met.

The appearance of work is an invitation to the public and scholarly community to share, review, discuss, and evaluate it (and its linked or associated research materials). Acceptance is not a statement of research quality, but rather that basic standards of reporting and topic relevance have been met.

SportRχiv accepts papers at any stage of the publication process. We moderate papers before they appear publicly, which is called “pre-moderation” on the Open Science Framework platform. To learn more about how this moderation works on our system, [visit this page from our hosts](https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019930553-Submitting-to-a-Moderated-Preprint-Service). Subject to volume demands, we expect to post papers submitted for moderation within 3-5 business days (although we aim to turn this around as quickly as possible).

**The SportRχiv moderation process ensures submissions:**

>    Qualify as scholarly content. This includes original research, current opinions, commentaries, review articles, case studies, short communications, hypotheses, ‘negative’ results, technical reports, and data and methods papers. Work on SportRχiv is either research or engages with research. As such, we do not accept blog posts, dissertations (submit such documents to thesiscommons.org), or other communications that do not adhere to academic publishing standards.

>    Fit our scope of research. We accept work from across all domains of Sport, Exercise, and Physical Activity. This includes, but is not limited to, Rehabilitation Sciences; Sport and Exercise Sciences; Sport and Exercise Studies; and Theatre, Dance and Performance Studies.

>    Are approriately categorized. We allow authors to select their own categories from our subject taxonomy, but check whether there are obvious errors or categorizations that lack plausibility.

> Are correctly attributed. We do a simple Internet search to see if someone else has publicly claimed authorship of the work.

> Are in languages that we can moderate. At this time we are only accepting English langauge submissions.

Please see review our Submission Guidelines, and check for compliance with our database of Journal Policies before submitting.

## Copyright compliance

Moderation does not include verification of copyright status—This responsibility lies with submitting authors. We ask that authors share only that work they have the right to share. When work is in review or about to go into review, authors may wish to check the SHERPA/RoMEO [website](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/index.php) or individual journal policies for peace of mind. Please note, however, that the vast majority of publishers permit the sharing of preprints. If you are uncertain about this part of the procedure, please contact us.

Claims of copyright infringement should be sent to the Center for Open Science in accordance with their policy, which is [here](https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/cos.io/blob/master/TERMS_OF_USE.md).
Procedure

Work will be reviewed by a moderator before appearing publicly within the SportRχiv repository. If a submission is not accepted, the moderator will include a description of the reason. Work that does not pass moderation will remain on the OSF platform, but will not be identified as part of SportRχiv. Authors are free to re-submit work after addressing the issues raised by the moderator. Authors may also contact us at andy@sportrxiv.org.

Please note: At present we do not have the capacity to query authors during the moderation process. If a paper does not pass moderation we will specify reasons, but we cannot discuss the reasons with the author prior to making a decision. Please do not be discouraged by negative moderation decisions and feel free to contact us with any questions!
